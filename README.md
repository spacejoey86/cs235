### About this repository
- Don't push to the [master](https://github.com/barnabwhy/cs230-a2/tree/master) branch, instead make a pull request [(?)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your changes.
- Pull requests require 1 review [(?)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to be merged, this means that you need to get someone else to look at your code and check it's okay to be combined into the master branch.
  - This helps stop us ending up with some code somewhere that might not work properly.
  - To review someone's code, go to their pull request on the GitHub website and look through (and optionally test) their code. Then, annotating the code where necessary, request changes or mark it as approved. [How to review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)
- To have changes merged, your own branch (the one you're making a pull request from) should be up-to-date with the master branch [(?)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/keeping-your-pull-request-in-sync-with-the-base-branch) so that extra effort isn't needed when merging changes and so that your code is known to work with the current code.

The reason it's set up like this is so we don't fuck something up and have to revert a load of changes.

If you have any questions about working in the repository, just ask in the Discord. I (Barnaby) will be happy to help with anything.
